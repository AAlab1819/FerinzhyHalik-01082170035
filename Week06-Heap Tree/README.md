# THE RUNNING MEDIAN

  1. input the numbers >n
  2. from the n number, there are n lines
  3. sort the numbers
  4. the median will be aquired from the addtion of the inputted number divided by 2
  
  
  complexity: O (n log n)
  
 # ROY AND THE TRENDING TOPICS
 
  -	When a topic is mentioned in a 'Post', its z-score is increased by 50.
  -	A 'Like' on such a Post, increases the z-score by 5.
  -	A 'Comment' increases z-score by 10.
  -	A 'Share' causes an increment of 20.
  
   The Output is to print 5 topics each in a new line
   each line should contain two space separated integers (the Topics and the new z-score of topic).
   
   
   complexity: O (n log n)

    **The problem** is that Grisha need to know how much the crystal needed to make another ball.
    and the information that is given is :
    ```
     a Yellow Ball is made from 2 Yellow Crystals
    ```
    ```
     a Green Ball is made from 1 Yellow Crystal and 1 Blue Crystal
    ```
    ```
     a Blue Ball is made from 3 Blue Crystals
    ```
    
    and The Solution is :
    
    Just to calculate all of the crystals needed and then substract with the amount of crystals that we have
    we have the information that each ball need only 2 types of crystals, which is **Yellow Crystal** and **Blue Crystal**
    so we can split it into 2 groups.
    
    i use the calculation and print it right away :
    ```
    (y(ellow)B(all)*2+g(reen)B(all))-Y(ellow)c(rystal))+(g(reen)B(all)+b(lue)B(all)*3)-B(lue)c(rystal))
    ```
    where the green ball is in the both of the operation.
    Yellow Ball needed 2 crystals and a green ball needed 1 yellow crystal, so we sum the amount of crystals needed and we do the same          thing to the green ball and the blue ball, where the blue ball needed 3 blue crystals and again, the green one only needed 1 blue          crystal,and at the end of the operation, we can see that the sum of the crystals needed are need to be substracted from the amount of crystals that we have.
    
    
    
2. Fraction
    **The problem** here is to find the highest possible fraction that can't be simplified.
    we know that the number *n* is the sum of 2 numbers. And the numerator must be smaller than the denominator.
    we need to search for the highest numerator and denominator, so we can choose what numbers to be printed out.
    to choose its an even or an odd number, we need to choose, because we know that if an even number is divided by 2 will left over         1 as the remains.
    the formula that we use to seperate the odd from the even is using the if else function.
    if the *n* that we inputted is odd, then the formula will sort out the number and then put it in the formula, and the other way         around with the even number
    we sorted out, because if the divided number is still even, it meant that *the number is still can be divided*
    thats why we will substract 1 on the numerator to make the number odd (which cant be divided by 2)
    and then we print out the rest of the numbers that calculated by the formula.

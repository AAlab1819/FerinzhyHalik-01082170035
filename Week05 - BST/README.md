## Party (115A).

```
The first line contains integer n (number of employee).\
Second line contains n line contain integer.\
To do this problem, make the employee who has no superior (`-1`) to be the root.
And you have to print the depth of the tree.

Complexity(Worst Case) : O(n log n)

## Christmas Spruce (913B).

```
The first line contains one integer n (how much is the vertices)\
Second input is n-1 (index of the parent i-th vertex)\
We are asked to find out if the rooted tree is a spruce if its every non-leaf vertex has at least 3 leaf children or no\

## Registration system (4C).
```
The first line contains number n
The following n lines contain the requests to the system
Each request is a non-empty line, and consists of not more than 32 characters, which are all lowercase Latin letters.

using map of <string,int>, we can record the data of the usernames that we inputted

# Buttons (268B)
\
A single line contains integer buttons (how many buttons it have)\
\
```buttons = int(input())```\
\
I assign push = buttons(input).\
\
```push = buttons```\
\
Then for loop 1 to buttons (how many time pushed).\
\
```for i in range(1,buttons):```\
\
the formula to solve the problem (the worst case scenario).\
\
```push += i*(buttons-i)```\
After the for loop is done, print the answer (push)\
\
```print(push)```
\
Complexity: O(n)
